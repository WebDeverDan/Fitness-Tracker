  # Fitness Tracker
  
  ## Description
  
  * This application is an fitness tracker. The user will be able to view the statistics from their last workout on the homescreen. If they want to add to that workout, they are able to input the relevant information and then save it to that workout. If they want to add a new workout on a different day, they have that option as well. The user is able to see their total minutes of activity broken down per day in a line graph, as well as a chart of their total pounds lifted during resistance training. This application is best used by one individual.
